# student_result
Using R language analysis of students result from .csv files and read them and program in R language
This R script analyzes student performance data stored in a CSV file, identifying high achievers, passed and failed students, top performers in each subject, and generating visualizations using pie charts. The read.csv function reads the CSV file and creates a data frame called data. The script filters students with a percentage greater than 80% and stores the result in high_achievers. It categorizes passed and failed students based on their status and prints the respective lists. The script then finds the top performers in each subject and prints their details. The top 5 students in each subject are sorted by each subject's scores in descending order, and the top 10 students overall are sorted by their percentage in descending order. The script generates pie charts to visualize the distribution of scores in each subject, with each chart colored differently for better distinction.
